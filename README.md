# Sign-language-recognition-using-CNN-and-Machine-Learning
This project involves creating a Sign Language Recognition system using hand landmarks detected via MediaPipe and a machine learning model. The system captures hand gestures, processes the landmarks, and trains a machine learning model to recognize these gestures. In this project i have made random gestures which are not official sign language gestures and i made them only for fun purposeand trying out different stuff. I will also upload another repository which has actual hand sign gestures for different alphabets in some time.

Project Structure
The project is divided into several stages:

Data Collection: Capture hand landmarks for custom sign language gestures.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the captured dataset.
Real-Time Prediction: Use the trained model to recognize gestures in real-time.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7 or later
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Joblib
Installation
Use the following commands to install the required packages:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
